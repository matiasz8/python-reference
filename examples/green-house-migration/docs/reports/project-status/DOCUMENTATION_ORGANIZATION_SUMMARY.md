## 🎯 Objective

Organize all scattered project documentation and reports into a coherent and easily navigable structure, following technical documentation best practices.

## ✅ Completed Work

### 📁 Structure Reorganization

#### 1. Reports Directory Creation (`docs/reports/`)

```
docs/reports/
├── README.md                     # Reports overview
├── project-status/               # Project status
│   ├── PROJECT_STATUS.md
│   ├── PROJECT_STATUS_REPORT.md
│   └── ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md
├── improvements/                 # Implemented improvements
│   ├── IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md
│   └── MARKDOWN_FIXES_SUMMARY.md
├── development/                  # Development guides
│   ├── PRE_COMMIT_GUIDE.md
│   └── GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md
└── security/                     # Security reports
    ├── README.md
    ├── bandit-reports/
    ├── vulnerability-scans/
    ├── security-audits/
    └── recommendations/
